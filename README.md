# Traffic Signs Recognition

### Objective
We aim to build the traffic signs detection models from the scratch and research the concept of YOLO framework for solving video object detection problem. 

### Dataset
We use the coco128 dataset. You can check and download them from: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ultralytics/coco128)

### Concept
- Batch Normalization [Paper](https://paperswithcode.com/method/batch-normalization)
- Real-Time Object Detection Using YOLO [Paper] (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351411017_Real-Time_Object_Detection_using_YOLO_A_review)

### Provided
Documents Folder - The report about our research problem
Traffic_Sign.py - Code we used for creating the object-detect model and exporting them.
App.py - Code is used for detect the name of traffic signs by using model that we exported them.

### Pretrained models
my_model.h5 - The model we created for all object-detection 
traffic_classifier.h5 - The model we created for traffic signs detection
